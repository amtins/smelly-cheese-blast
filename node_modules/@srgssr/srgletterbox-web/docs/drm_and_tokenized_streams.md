# DRM and Tonekized Streams

## DRM Playback

Letterbox Web supports __Dash__ and __HLS__ DRM playback on identified devices. __DASH DRM__ playback is done via __[Dash.js<sup>1</sup>](https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js/releases/tag/v2.9.3)__ which is used by almost all devices, except Apple devices *(except Edge on MacOS which uses Dash too)*. __HLS DRM__ playback is done via __[Video.js VHS](https://github.com/videojs/http-streaming)__ which is used by Apple devices.

List of Supported Operating Systems and Devices<sup>2</sup> :

* __Android__
    - Chrome version greater than 34
    - Edge version greater than or equal 41.1
* __Chrome OS__
    - Chrome version greater than 34
* __Linux__
    - Chrome version greater than 34
    - Firefox version greater than 47
* __MacOS__
    - Chrome version greater than 34
    - Edge version greater than or equal 79
    - Firefox version greater than 47
    - Opera version greater than or equal 44
    - Safari version greater than or equal 8
* __Windows__
    - Chrome version greater than or equal 34
    - Edge version greater than or equal 17
    - Firefox version greater than 47
    - Opera version greater than or equal 44

__* NB__ :
1. __Dash.js__ will be removed in favor of __Video.js VHS__ when the issue [256](https://github.com/videojs/http-streaming/issues/256) is fixed.
2. The above values indicate that the OS or device supports DRM playback at the specified version, but not that Letterbox supports the browser version, which is part of another set of rules. For example, Safari 8 is not supported.

## Tonekized Streams

Letterbox Web supports playback of streams protected by an Akamai-generated HMAC.
