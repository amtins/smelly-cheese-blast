# How to use Aspect Ratio

Letterbox offers and API that allows integrators to set the video's aspect ratio. Also to facilitate the video's proper aspect ratio, the [Integration Layer](http://www.srfcdn.ch/developer-docs/integrationlayer/api/public/swagger/index.html?url=intlayer-srgplay.json#/MediaComposition/MediaCompositionByUrn) `MediaComposition` offers an `aspectRatio` property.

## Aspect Ratio key concepts

There is three major concepts to keep in mind when manually setting the aspect ratio.

1. The `aspectRatio` values must be a string formated like `m:n`, for example `1:1`, `4:3`, `16:9`, etc.
2. When the aspect ratio is set manually, the player updates its mode from `fill` (default Letterbox's mode) to `fluid`.
3. To reset the aspect ratio, the function `fill(true)` must be called.

## Player layout

As stated above, Letterbox uses the videojs `fill` mode. This means that a container with a width and height must be provided, then the player will fill up the entire space.

Also, keep in mind that when the player is `fill(true)` or `fluid(true)`, the `width` and `height` methods from videojs have not effect. To manually set the `width` or `height`, the player must be `fill(false)` or `fluid(false)`.
